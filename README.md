# Slack Status
Endpoint for an outgoing slack webhook that posts status updates as xapi statements

Use this PHP script with a [Slack Outgoing Webhook](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/outgoing-webhooks) 
to track status updates posted to Slack and return the % of working days in the last month that a status has been
posted. 

Edit and rename config-dist.php to config.php to configure.
